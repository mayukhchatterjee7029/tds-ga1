**Common error types:**
- Missing commas between array/object elements
- Extra commas before closing braces/brackets
- Missing quotes around property names
- Single quotes instead of double quotes
- Missing or extra braces/brackets

## Task

2. Fix all syntax errors
3. Validate the JSON parses correctly
4. Submit the fixed JSON

## Validation

You can validate JSON using:

**Python:**
```bash

```

## Tips

- Use a text editor with JSON syntax highlighting (VS Code, Sublime)
